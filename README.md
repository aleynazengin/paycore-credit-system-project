## Getting Started

The source code can be checked out to your local and then build and run the application either from your IDE after importing to it as a maven project, or just from a command line. Follow these steps for the command-line option:  

### Prerequisites
1. Java 8
2. Maven 3
3. Git
4. PostgreSQL


### Installing & Running

RabbitMQ will be available at the URL: [RabbitMQ](http://localhost:5672).

##Docker
First you need to uncomment this line in application.properties;

* spring.profiles.active=docker

Start Docker Engine in your machine.

Run mvn clean install.

## API Documentation

API documentation can be accessed via [Swagger UI](http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html) 

## Architectural Approach
This application developed using Monolithic Approach.
When your application doesnâ€™t require advanced scalability and the complexity is manageable, then a monolith architecture is the best road to go down.

Monoliths have the following advantages:
1. Monoliths are easier for development so they are faster to develop.
2. You can easily control monoliths.
3. Testing monoliths is easy.
